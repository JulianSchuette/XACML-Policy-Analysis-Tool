{"name":"Xacml-inspect","body":"### Welcome to XACML Inspector\r\nThis tool analyses XACML policies by transforming them into an OWL ontology and a Prolog representation. Via a web interface, the transformed policy can be downloaded and it can be analysed for questions such as\r\n\r\n* is the policy consistent?\r\n* which attributes are required to answer a request?\r\n* which requests would lead to a certain decision?\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nTo get started with XACML inspector, you will first need SWI-Prolog. [Get it here](http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html) and install it.\r\n\r\nThen, checkout the eclipse project in this repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir ~/xacmlinspect\r\n$ cd ~/xacmlinspect\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/quadriat/XACML-Inspect.git\r\n```\r\nOpen eclipse and import the project `PolicyAnalysisTool` from `~/xacmlinspect/PolicyAnalysisTool` into your workspace.","tagline":"Analyse XACML policies using Prolog reasonig","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
