XACML Policy Analyser
=============

This tool allows to analyse XACML policies with logical reasoning. It translates a XACML file into an OWL ontology and to a Prolog representation and runs queries on them.
A GWT (Google Web Toolkit) web interface is included. 

The code is in a very early stage and is a leftover of another project, but it is functional and should be easy to extend.

Running
-------

Running the code should be fairly simple:

* Check out the code as an eclipse project. The eclipse plugin GWT tools is not required, but may be helpful during development.
* Start the included launch configuration "Analysr"

In case you make any modifications to the code, please be so kind and contribute them to this project.
